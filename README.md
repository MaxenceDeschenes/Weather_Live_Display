# Weather_Live_Display
Weather_Live_Display is an FPGA system that receives live temperature data via UART and displays it on a 6-digit 7-segment display. It includes a UART receiver, digit storage, and a 200Hz display driver. A Python script fetches Ottawaâ€™s weather from the Open-Meteo API and transmits the temperature to the FPGA for real-time updates.
